<ul>
<li>
The highest ranking content is determined by the most knowledgeable users, not the most popular.</li>
<li>When a user makes a comment or approves an article, then the ranking of that comment or article is increased based on the users knowledge of subject area that the article is about</li>
<li>How do we know how much a user knows about a subject? We ask them. Every article has a question form below it which contains a question related to the subject of the article.
If the user answers this question correctly, then we know that he knows something about the subject and we grant him more ranking power in that subject area.</li>
<li>What does the word "Syytacit" mean?<ul><li>"Syytacit" is a combination of the words "syyt√§" from the Finnish word for merit and "tacit" from "tacit knowledge"</li></ul>
